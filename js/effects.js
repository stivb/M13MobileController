var effectDescriptions =
    {
    "Dynamic Delay":"Made popular by the T.C. Electronic® 2290 Dynamic Digital Delay. While you play, the Dynamic Delay keeps the volume of the echoes turned down, so that the echoes don’t overwhelm what you’re doing. ",
    "Auto-Volume Delay":"This model gives you two effects in one. A volume fadein swell used for a bowing effect. The other effect is an echo, complete with tape-style wow and flutter modulation.",
     "Echo Platter":"Based on* the Binson EchoRec. A staple for the likes of Pink Floyd. Rather than using tape, the EchoRec used a magnetic platter to record and play back. (This Model is actually not available in DL4, but comes from our Echo Pro rack unit.) Note that you can duplicate DL4’s Rhythmic Delay feature by setting tap tempo to your choice of note values—and you get to do that with any Delay",
    "Opto Tremolo":"Based on* the optical tremolo circuit that was used in the blackface Fender® amps, like the ’64 Deluxe Reverb®.",
